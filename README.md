# Final Micro Project

Created by:
Victor H. Brendan C.

Objective: To create a working project that effectively uses the dual ADC, in conjunction with the analog jostick on the MSP4300G2553.

The project will display a light on the 3x3 matrix that will correspond to the position of the joystick.

There is more detailed information on the wiring, set-up, and program use within the comments of the code. 
We have also included an image of the wiring diagram, and the actual fritzing file.
